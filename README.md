# VDMR-DBSCAN
Research Work which I conducted as a part of my Master's thesis.  Proposed a Map Reduce based scalable Density based clustering algorithm which is able to find clusters of varied density. 

It contains the complete paper published @ BDA 2015 Proceedings of the 4th International Conference on Big Data Analytics - Volume 9498
Complete thesis work with application of the algorithm is also commited.
